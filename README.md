# DA-Project
Game Recommender

The project aims to aid and guide people who seek to find new games that are related to the ones they play. The project will mostly target the young demographic and the data that is needed will be collected from Steam API. The csv files that will be retrieved will be used for its
genre contents and so, if that condition is met (the csv file has the game and genre columns, we can use it), which means the inflow of data is flexible. As for the algorithm, we chose Cosine Similarity Algorithm for the similarity between two inner product space vectors measured by this algorithm. It checks whether two vectors are roughly pointing in the same direction by measuring the cosine of the angle between them. In text analysis, it is frequently used to assess document similarity, this is where the genres of the games the user plays enter.
